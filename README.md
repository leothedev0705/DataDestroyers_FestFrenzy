# FestFrenzy Event Management System

Welcome to FestFrenzy, your all-in-one solution for managing events at educational institutions! With FestFrenzy, you can streamline the process of organizing and coordinating events across different committees, ensuring seamless collaboration and efficient event management.

## Overview

In every educational institution, effective coordination of numerous student committees spanning technical, cultural, and social domains is essential. However, conducting events within these committees presents a complex challenge. It involves navigating through approval processes across different departments and authorities, securing venue permissions, and ensuring seamless scheduling that avoids conflicts with other events and lectures.

## Key Features

### Event Setup and Approval
- Different committees need a way to set up events and get approvals from the right college departments.
- Approval from the Principal, the Dean of Student Affairs, the Head of Department (H.O.D), and the Faculty Mentor are essential.

### Student Participation
- Students should have a way to join in on these events and stay in the loop about what's happening on campus.
  
### Venue Availability
- Committees should be able to check when rooms and venues are available to avoid event overlap.
